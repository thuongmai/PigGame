## I) GAME RULES:

**a) Normal**
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game

**b) Two-dice pig**
This variation is the same as Pig, except:
- Two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the turn total.
- If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends.
- If two 1s are rolled, the playerâ€™s entire score is lost, and the turn ends.
- If a double is rolled, the point total is added to the turn total as with any roll but the player is obligated to roll again (possible sub-variation of the two-dice game)

**c) Big Pig**
This variation is the same as Two-Dice Pig, except:
- If two 1s are rolled, the player adds 25 to the turn total.
- If other doubles are rolled, the player adds twice the value of the dice to the turn total.

## II) GAMEPLAY:

- **SPACE BAR** to focus on **FINAL SCORE** box to change the maximum score that player can reach to win the game. Leave it empty by default will be 100
- **ENTER** or **Start** button to start the new game with the input Final Score
- **UP** or **ROLL** button to roll a dice/dices
- **DOWN** or **HOLD** button to hold your current score, add it to Total score, then leave the turn to other player
